# Contributing

To add yourself to the contributors list

Comment on Issue or Pull Request, asking @all-contributors to add a contributor:
```
@all-contributors please add @<username> for <contributions>
```
<contribution>: See the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid contribution types.

The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor, then reply with the pull request details.
